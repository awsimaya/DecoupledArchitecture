* You just published the Web application to Amazon ECS
* Once complete, you will be able to see a new ECS service called **LeaveWebApp** on the AWS console

#### Configure XRay for the ECS Service
> In this section, we will create a X-Ray daemon container which will run as a side-car container  along with the LeaveWebApp container to process and send X-Ray data to the X-Ray service on AWS.

> More about this topic here - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon-ecs.html

* Open PowerShell and execute the following commands. The first command pulls the **aws-xray-daemon** container image from docker hub. The second command tags the image as **xraydaemon**
```docker
docker pull amazon/aws-xray-daemon
docker tag amazon/aws-xray-daemon:latest xraydaemon:latest
```
* Login to AWS console and navigate to **Amazon ECS**. Click **Repositories** on the left navigation section
* Click **Create repository** and name it **xraydaemon**
* Click **Create repository** 
* Click on **View push commands** on the top right of the screen
* Choose Windows or macOS/Linux tab and execute the command from Step 1. The command will return a very long URL. Copy and paste the URL into the command line and press enter.
* Skip the step 2 command, because we already have the container image downloaded from docker hub earlier. Execute commands from Step 3 and Step 4.
* Once complete, go to the **xraydaemon** repository on the AWS ECR home page and ensure the new image has been published successfully
* Navigate to **Task Definitions** on **Amazon ECS** home page and click **LeaveWebApp**
* Select the latest version and click **Create new revision**
* Under **Container Definitions** click **Add container**
* Name the container **xray-daemon**
* Copy and paste the container image URI from **xraydaemon** ECR repo into the **Image** textbox
* Click **Add** button at the bottom
* Select the newly created version of the Task Definition
* Select **Actions** -> **Update Service**
* Select **LeaveWebApp** in the **Cluster** dropdown
* Check **Force new deployment** checkbox
* Click **Next step** in the next few screens until you get to **Review** screen. Click **Update Service**
* You just finished deploying the Leave Web App to Amazon ECS 

### Test drive the application
* Copy and paste the DNS name of the **LeaveWebApp** ALB from the EC2 home page on AWS console into a browser and press enter
* You should be able to see the application as shown below
![LeaveWebAppHome](/images/LeaveWebAppHome.png)
* You can Submit a Leave Request and also Approve a Leave Request using this application by clicking on the appropriate links.
* Once you submit a Leave Request, you will see an email arrive in your email inbox that you configured earlier
* Also another email will land in your email inbox once you approve a request as well
* After you play around with the application for a while, you can navigate to X-Ray home page on AWS console and click **Service map**
* You should be able to see the service map as shown below
